# routes
VB.NET - manage route data


Application our truck team uses to do the following:
 - enter and document hours worked for each day
 - enter/edit route job information for each day
 - view reports for payroll, job and other relevant information
 
Built using VB.NET connecting to a SQL Server backend

I think this project was originally created around 2010 and has since been extended/modified.  My business partner and I have talked several times about sunsetting this application and process for saving route information but it hasn't been a priority so I continue supporting it with changes along the way.
